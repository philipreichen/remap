# remap
Remap certain windows keys to behave more like macOS keys.
Ever since I started using a custom-built (Windows) PC, I started to have to mentally and physically switch between using a keyboard and its shortcuts on a Mac and on a PC. What really started to bother me was the fact that the Ctrl key on Windows is at the very left end of the keyboard. Which means that all the keyboard shortcuts to copy/paste/cut etc. are very inaccessible, as compared to the cmd key on a Mac which is right next to the spacebar.
This script together with Autohotkey resolves that issue and emulates the most important keyboard shortcuts, such as copy/paste/reload/close etc. on a Windows machine as you'd expect them to work on a Mac, _without_ compromising the Alt+Tab windows switching functionality.
I've been using this remap for less than an hour but can already tell that my productivity on my Windows machine has gone up dramatically.
